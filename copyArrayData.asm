; the first line of code segment initialization

; but not for ds we have to do it manually

start:

mov es,ax

;load_effective_address of arr1 to source index register 
;load_effective_address of arr2 to destination idnex register

lea si,arr1
lea di,arr2

mov cx,[si]         
;mov ch,00h

;increment si to go to the next index
;because the first index is the length 
;which is doesn't need to be copied
inc si

;clear direction flag to go from low index to high index
